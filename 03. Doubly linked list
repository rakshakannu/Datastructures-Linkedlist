// a node points to the next node as well as the previous node

class node{
  int data;
  node next;
  node prev;
  node(int d){
    data = d;
  }
}

// Advantages over sinlgy linked list
1. traverse in both the directions.
2. we can delete a given node in o[1] time.
3. we can insert/delete a node BEFORE A GIVEN NODE in O[1] time.

// Disadvantages
1. space required for extra pointer with every node.
2. the code becomes complex as extra pointer has to be maintained everywhere.
