// advantages
1. can traverse the whole list from any node.
2. we can insert an item at the beginning as well as end in O[1] time by maintaining just one pointer.
( useful for queue implementation )
implementing algorithms like round robin.

// disadvantages
1. codes for traversal, insertion, deletion etcb become slightly complex

// can be a singly or doubly circular linked list
