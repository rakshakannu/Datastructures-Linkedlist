// given two linkedlists, they have some common nodes which starts from an intersection point, we need to find the intersection  point.

// method 1
1. create an empty hashset.
2. traverse the first list and put all elements into it.
3. traverse the second node and look for every node in hashset. as soon as we find a node, return that node.

time: O(m+n)
space: O(m)

// method 2
time: O(m+n)
space: O(1)

1. traverse both lists and count the nodes in it. let them be c1 and c2.
2. find abs(c1-c2) = d
3. traverse the bigger list d times.
4. now traverse both the list simultaneously till we find a common node.
