// assume they will never tell you to delete last node
// this is a trick interview question

trick - copy the data of the next node into the given node and delete the next node

void deleteNode(node ptr)
{
  ptr.data = ptr.next.data;
  ptr.next = ptr.next.next;
}

this wont work for deleting the last node of linkedlist. It will result in null pointer exception in java.
